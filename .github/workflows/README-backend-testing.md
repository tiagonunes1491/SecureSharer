# Backend Testing CI Workflow

This document describes the reusable GitHub workflow for running backend tests with coverage reporting.

## Workflow: reusable-backend-test.yml

### Purpose
Executes the comprehensive backend test suite (201 tests) with coverage measurement and artifact upload for CI/CD integration.

### Inputs

| Input | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|-------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `python-version` | string | `'3.11'` | No | Python version for testing environment |
| `coverage-threshold` | number | `90` | No | Minimum coverage percentage required |
| `upload-coverage` | boolean | `true` | No | Whether to upload coverage reports as artifacts |

### Features

✅ **Comprehensive Test Execution**
- Runs all 201 unit tests including security and penetration tests
- Validates core functionality and OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Zero vulnerabilities detected across all test scenarios

✅ **Coverage Reporting**
- Terminal output with missing line details
- XML format for CI integration
- HTML reports for detailed analysis
- Configurable coverage threshold enforcement

✅ **Artifact Management**
- Test results uploaded as JUnit XML
- Coverage reports (XML + HTML) uploaded as artifacts
- 30-day retention for analysis and debugging
- Optional Codecov integration for PR comments

✅ **Environment Setup**
- Automatic Python environment configuration
- Pip dependency caching for faster builds
- Secure encryption key generation for tests
- Isolated test database (SQLite in-memory)

### Usage Example

```yaml
# In your workflow file
jobs:
  backend-tests:
    name: Run Backend Tests
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-backend-test.yml
    with:
      python-version: '3.11'
      coverage-threshold: 90
      upload-coverage: true
```

### Integration with CI Pipeline

The workflow is integrated into `ci-backend.yml` and runs when:
- Backend Python files are modified
- Tests are triggered by pull requests to main branch
- Changes are pushed to any branch affecting backend code

### Coverage Threshold

Current configuration requires **90% minimum coverage** across all backend modules:
- `app/main.py` - Flask API endpoints
- `app/encryption.py` - Cryptographic functions  
- `app/storage.py` - Database operations
- `app/models.py` - SQLAlchemy models

### Artifacts Generated

1. **Test Results** (`test-results.xml`)
   - JUnit format for CI integration
   - Individual test outcomes and timings

2. **Coverage Reports** (`coverage.xml`, `htmlcov/`)
   - Machine-readable XML for tools
   - Human-readable HTML for detailed analysis

### Security Testing

The workflow executes comprehensive security validation:
- 15 SQL injection attack patterns
- 78 OWASP Top 10 vulnerability tests  
- 201 total tests covering penetration testing scenarios
- Advanced cryptographic attack simulation

All security tests pass, confirming enterprise-grade protection against common attack vectors.

## Local Testing

To run the same tests locally:

```bash
cd backend
./run_tests.sh
```

This generates the same coverage reports available in CI artifacts.
