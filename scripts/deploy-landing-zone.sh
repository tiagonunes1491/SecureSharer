# Modular Landing Zone Deployment Script
# =====================================================
#
# This script provides modular deployment capabilities for the Secure Secret Sharer
# landing zone infrastructure. It supports deploying specific components independently
# or as a complete solution.
#
# Components:
# - Shared: Common infrastructure (artifacts RG, shared UAMIs, ACR permissions)
# - K8S: Kubernetes-specific resources (AKS spoke RG, K8S UAMIs, RBAC)
# - PaaS: Platform-as-a-Service resources (Container Apps spoke RG, PaaS UAMIs, RBAC)
#
# Usage Examples:
#   ./deploy-landing-zone.sh shared    # Deploy only shared infrastructure
#   ./deploy-landing-zone.sh k8s       # Deploy shared + K8S landing zone
#   ./deploy-landing-zone.sh paas      # Deploy shared + PaaS landing zone
#   ./deploy-landing-zone.sh all       # Deploy everything (shared + K8S + PaaS)
#   ./deploy-landing-zone.sh teardown  # Delete all landing zone resource groups
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Azure CLI installed and authenticated (az login)
# - Appropriate permissions to create subscriptions-level resources
# - GitHub repository configured for OIDC (update .bicepparam files with org/repo)
